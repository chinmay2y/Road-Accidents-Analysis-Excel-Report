Road Accident Analysis Excel Report

Project Objective:

The objective of this project is to analyze road accident data from 2021 and 2022 to identify key trends, patterns, and factors contributing to accidents. The insights derived aim to inform road safety measures and policy-making to reduce accident severity and frequency.

Analysis: 

Accident Severity: Categorized as Fatal, Serious, or Slight.

Road Type Analysis: Examined accidents across different road types such as single carriageways, roundabouts, and dual carriageways.

Casualties by Area: Compared casualty percentages in urban vs. rural areas.

Monthly Trends: Analyzed monthly accident trends to identify peaks and troughs.

Day vs. Night: Evaluated accident occurrences during daylight and nighttime.

Road Surface Conditions: Investigated the impact of surface conditions like wet, dry, and icy roads on accident frequency.

Vehicle Type Analysis: Identified the types of vehicles most frequently involved in accidents.

Weather Impact: Assessed how weather conditions influenced accident rates.

Outcomes :

High-Risk Road Types: Single carriageways recorded the maximum casualties.

Urban Dominance: Around 59% of accidents occurred in urban areas.

Peak Months: Accident numbers spiked in certain months, requiring seasonal interventions.

Daylight and Night Proportions: Accidents were almost evenly distributed between daylight (51%) and nighttime (49%).

Surface Conditions: Wet or damp road conditions were a significant factor in accidents.

Vehicle Type: Cars accounted for 77% of the vehicles involved, highlighting their dominance in accident statistics.

This analysis provides actionable insights for stakeholders to optimize road safety campaigns, improve infrastructure, and mitigate high-risk conditions.
